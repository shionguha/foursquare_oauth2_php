foursquare_oauth2_php
=====================

This is a code repository for connecting to the foursquare API (https://developer.foursquare.com) via Oauth2 and PHP. This is meant for academic uses only. I make no pretense about code quality but you are welcome to use it if you feel it might be useful.
