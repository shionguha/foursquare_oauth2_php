foursquare_oauth2_php
=====================

This is a code repository for connecting to the foursquare API (https://developer.foursquare.com) via Oauth2 and PHP. This is meant for academic uses only. I make no pretense about code quality but you are welcome to use it if you feel it might be useful.

I am a graduate student of information science just learning to produce some rudimentary scripts. This codebase is meant to be a record of my research activities here.
